# ALIENS-R-REAL - JavaScript Challenge 

In this little HTML/JavaScript project, we exercise our acquired JavaScript skills to display and filter a table with alledged UFU sightings. We are using the d3 library and plain modern JavaScript in this project.
Note that the design of the page is based on Bootstrap 3.3.7. It's taken from the starter html/javascript that was provided with the exercise instructions. There was too little time to customize the design.

## Background

For this project, I created two JavaScripts.

* [UFO-level-1](#UFO-level-1)
* [UFO-level-2](#UFO-level-2)


### <a name="UFO-level-1"></a>UFO-level-1

Inside the **UFO-level-1** folder, the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, JavaScript code appends the table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 
Each table has a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

The index file is located [here](.UFO-level-1/index.html).
The script file is located [here](./UFO-level-1/static/js/app.js).
The data file is located [here](./UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js).


### <a name="UFO-level-2"></a>UFO-level-2

Inside the **UFO-level-2** folder, the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, JavaScript code appends the table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. 
Each table has a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least. Used multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
date/time, city, state, country, shape

The index file is located [here](.UFO-level-2/index.html).
The script file is located [here](./UFO-level-2/static/js/app.js).
The data file is located [here](./UFO-level-2/static/js/data.js).

## Running the scripts

To run either one of the scripts:

* Run the script by including the data.js and app.js JavaScript file in HTML file and then in Visual Studio select go live and run the HTML file in browser, which has app.js JavaScript file get execute.

## Technologies used

The following technologies were used to build the scripts:

* JavaScript
* HTML
